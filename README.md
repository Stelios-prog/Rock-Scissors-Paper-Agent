# Image Classification and Processing Toolkit

This repository contains a set of Python scripts designed for image classification and processing tasks. The toolkit leverages TensorFlow and Keras to create and train deep learning models, process images, and make predictions.

## Scripts Overview

1. **my_model.py**
   - Defines a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using Keras.
   - Includes layers like Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, and Dropout.
   - The function `create_model` takes `input_shape` as an argument.

2. **first.py**
   - Main script that integrates the model defined in `my_model.py`.
   - Uses TensorFlow and Keras callbacks like EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau, and ModelCheckpoint.
   - Includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

3. **functions.py**
   - Contains utility functions for image processing.
   - Functions include `load_data`, `preprocess_image`, `play_game`, and `make_decision`.
   - Handles loading and preprocessing of images for model training and predictions.

## How to Use

1. Install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
   ```

2. Run `first.py` to train the model and evaluate its performance.

## Dependencies

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
